# Analysis of homicide data in Medellín
Unfortunately, one of the major issues in Medellín, Colombia (the city where I live) is the high levels of insecurity. In this case, data provided by the Medellín Mayor's Office database (MEData) was analyzed. Unfortunately, this data is no longer available. These data not only give us a good time window (almost 17 years) but also provide extensive information about homicides, including the victim's gender, location, and type of homicide, among other details.

Initially, the dataset is cleaned and the most relevant variables are defined. Tools and concepts from statistics are used, combined with Python's analysis and visualization tools.

Finally, a small classification model is developed with the help of machine learning.
